# Metal detector robot using atmega32  
### Members: Samuel Maged - Leena Almekkawy

## Project Idea 
The main function of the robot is that the robot moves randomly looking for a metal object and when the metal object will be found , the robot will stop then 
turn on buzzer for 5 seconds then turn off the buzzer and continue in moving.
This idea can be used in collecting metal objects in 
street and also can be used in searching for a missing 
metal object.
